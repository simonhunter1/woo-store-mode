# woo-store-mode
Plugin to enable opening and closing of WordPress WooCommerce stores by time of day. For example, if you operate a store which has 'lunch' and 'dinner' opening hours, this plugin can be used to set 'lunch' and 'dinner' modes, with opening and closing times for these modes.

Products can be assigned to each mode, in case you need to have products available in one or more modes only.
